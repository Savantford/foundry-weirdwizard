2. Find the version you'd like to install. The most recent versions are listed first.
3. At the end of the release post, find the `system.json` on the attachments.
4. Right click on it and copy the link address.
5. Follow the steps to install normally, but instead of using the provided `system.json` URL, use the specific version instead. Done!

## Contributions

This project was created and is currently maintained by @Savantford (Friend).

However, contributions were done directly to the project by a few awesome contributors:
- [@SolarizedRed](https://github.com/SolarizedRed): Initial styling and Fonts selection. A founder member!
- [@mhilbrunner](https://github.com/mhilbrunner): Lots of stuff. Lots of good stuff! They are too many to list, but many were valuable backend additions.
- [@yschnellbach](https://github.com/yschnellbach): Many contributions, mainly visual changes. The system wouldn't look the way it does without them!

Please make sure to thank all of them!

        "content": "<p><strong>Ancestries</strong>, <strong>Paths</strong>, <strong>Professions</strong> and <strong>Traditions</strong>, collectively called <strong>Character Options</strong> by the system, are <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/journal/\">journal entry pages</a> that share similar concepts and function.</p><p>Such functions and concepts are usually not intuitive at first glance. For this reason, this documentation was made to help setting up character options correctly.</p><h1>Benefits</h1><p><strong>Benefits</strong> are data blocks used by all Character Options, except Traditions.</p><p>All character options grant one or more benefits that might include:</p><ul><li><p>Changes to Stats: <strong>Defense (Natural or Armored)</strong>, <strong>Health</strong>, <strong>Size</strong>, <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Bonus Damage</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Common Traits &amp; Knowledge: creature <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>Senses</strong>, <strong>Languages</strong>, <strong>Special Movement Traits</strong>, <strong>Immunities</strong>, <strong>Traditions</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Regular Items: <strong>Traits</strong>, <strong>Talents</strong>, <strong>Equipment</strong> and <strong>Spells</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Both <strong>Ancestries</strong> and <strong>Professions</strong> grant the benefits straight away when applied. <strong>Paths</strong>, on the other hand, grant benefits on certain <strong>Levels</strong>.</p><h1>Item References</h1><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/items/\">Items</a> (Equipment, Traits, Talents, Spells etc) can be granted by some Character Option's benefits.</p><p>Since only <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/actors/\">actors</a> (Characters, NPCs, etc) can carry items, Character Options only record item <strong>UUIDs</strong> (universal IDs) as <strong>references</strong>.</p><p>This means that <strong>items must first be created in a Compendium</strong> in order to be used in a Character Option.</p><p>To create a proper item reference for a character option, follow the instructions below.</p><h2>Creating a New Item Reference</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Choose an Item Compendium:</strong> The first step is to create a new <strong>Item</strong> <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/compendium/\">compendium</a> or find one you already created and want to use for character options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose an Item:</strong> Select or create a new item from the Compendium chose in step 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drag and Drop the Item onto the Character Option:</strong> Drag the item from the Compendium and drop it onto one of the areas reserved for items in the Character Option's journal page. The areas will be <strong>highlighted</strong> to indicate where the item can be dropped.</p></li><li><p>Done!</p></li></ol><h2>Editing an Item</h2><p>Once an item reference is recorded in a Character Option, you can edit it by clicking on the <strong>edit button</strong> next to the item's name.</p><p>Remember that you'll be editing <strong>an item inside a compendium</strong>, so you might need to first unlock the compendium.</p><h2>Removing an Item Reference</h2><p>You can remove an item reference by clicking the <strong>trash bin button</strong> next to the item's name.</p><p>Remember that you are just <strong>removing the reference</strong> to the item, not the item itself. The item will stay in the compendium, untouched.</p><h1>Using Character Options</h1><p>After you are finished making a character option, you can drag it from the left sidebar in the Journal they are in and drop it onto an actor (Character, etc) sheet.</p><p>The actor will then have a link to the character option, and apply any changes it needs.</p>",

When you attack with the weapon, you roll with 1 boon and you can use Intellect or Will in place of the attribute you would normally use. Your attacks with the weapon deal an extra 1d6 damage from the flames. While you carry the weapon, you are immune to damage from fire and you take half damage from cold. Finally, you can use an action to touch the weapon to a flammable object and cause it to catch fire.</p>"

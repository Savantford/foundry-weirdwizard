They remain for 1 minute, but the effect ends early if you are doused in water. When a creature in your reach rolls to attack you, the creature makes a luck roll. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 damage. You can use this talent once, twice at level 3, and three times at level 7. You regain expended uses after you rest.</p>"

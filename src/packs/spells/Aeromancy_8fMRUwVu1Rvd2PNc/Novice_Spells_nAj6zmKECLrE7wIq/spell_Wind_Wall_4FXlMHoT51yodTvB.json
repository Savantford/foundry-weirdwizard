A creature that would move through the space makes a Strength roll, rolling with 1 boon for each point of Size above 3. On a failure, the creature is pushed back to the nearest empty space and its Speed becomes 0 until the end of the round. Finally, the wind imposes 3 banes on rolls to attack targets behind the target space using ranged attacks</p>"

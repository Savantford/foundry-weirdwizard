The target makes a Will roll. On a failure, you can issue one command to the target. Choose one of the activities that normally require the use of an action from those described in Chapter 2. On the target’s next turn, it must use an action to perform this activity. If it cannot, the target becomes confused (luck ends). You can use this talent once, twice at level 3, and three times at level 7. You regain expended uses after you rest.</p>"
